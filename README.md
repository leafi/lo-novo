  - XXX dont do this XXX make it turn-based (right now it's real-time)
  - write more 'default' code (e.g. pick up an item if it can be picked up)
  - maybe get into letting players choose classes?
  - maybe hook up multiplayer IRC stuff?
  -- joining, leaving the party etc. !join, !quit, ...
  - maybe look into loading & saving, and letting the game module be reloaded separately from the bit that sits on irc
  - actually write some game (important!!!)
